    Top-Selling Items Avocado Toast, Smoothies and Cold Brew dominate both revenue and volume.

    Underperforming Items Matcha Latte, Macchiato, and Energy Ball rank low in sales, suggesting a need for promotional or product positioning support.

    Popular Bundles Strong-performing combinations include

        Granola Bar + Smoothie

        Cookie + Tea
        These bundles reveal clear cross-category buying behavior and opportunities to anchor new promotions.

Key Insights
1. Retention Is Experience-Driven, Not Promo-Driven

74% of transactions don’t use promo codes - yet repeat visits and spend remain high. This points to product quality, atmosphere, and service as the main drivers of customer loyalty.
Promo codes like LOYAL10 and WEEKEND5 contribute marginal gains but don’t drive repeat behavior on their own.
2. Promo Code Transactions Show Higher Engagement

Customers using promo codes tend to

    Purchase slightly more items per visit (~1.38 vs. 1.35).

    Occasionally use non-revenue generating codes (like FREEDRINK), likely tied to loyalty rewards or special campaigns.

3. Underutilized Promo Opportunities

Promo codes are mostly used with Coffee-Based and Baked Goods categories.
Savory Foods and Snacks are under-targeted, despite being high-margin items. Promo codes and bundles could drive interest here.
Customer Segmentation & Strategic Leverage
Segment Profiles

    High-Value, Frequent Customers Reliable revenue drivers. Retain through exclusive early access to new products, loyalty perks, and recognition-based incentives.

    Mid-Value, Regular Customers Big opportunity. They're consistent but not maximizing spend.

        What to do Offer tiered loyalty rewards that unlock discounts, free items, or bonus points after specific spend thresholds.

        Example “Spend €20 this month, get a free Avocado Toast next visit.”

    High-Value, Infrequent Customers They love the café but don’t come often.

        Re-engage with time-sensitive offers (e.g., “We miss you — enjoy a free Cold Brew this weekend”).

    Low-Value, Frequent Customers Loyal but low spend.

        Increase basket size with simple upsell prompts “Add a Cookie for €1 with any drink.”

Product Acceleration Strategy Promote the Underperformers
Goal Increase visibility and sales of items like Matcha Latte, Macchiato, and Energy Ball.
Action Plan

    Pair them with best-sellers

        “Green Boost Combo” Matcha Latte + Granola Bar at a discount.

        “Afternoon Energy Deal” Energy Ball + Cold Brew.

        “Mini Macchiato Morning” Macchiato + Cookie, targeted at light spenders.

    Use Top Customer Segments to Drive Trial

        Offer exclusive limited-time bundles to mid-value customers via loyalty program emails.

        Example “New combo just for you Matcha Latte + any pastry for €4.50.”

    Run Time-Based Experiments

        Promote underperformers during slower hours.

        Example “2–4 PM Calm Hour — 20% off Matcha Latte with any purchase.”

    Menu Engineering

        Redesign in-store and digital menus to highlight these bundles with visuals and suggested pairings. Position them next to top performers to drive cross-sell.

Loyalty Program Enhancement

To increase customer lifetime value and shift mid-tier spenders into high-value territory

    Tiered Reward System

        Entry Level 1 point per €1, unlock free Cookie at 30 points

        Silver Level Early access to promos, free drink on birthday

        Gold Level Exclusive bundle discounts, first access to new menu items

    Digital Tracking & Engagement

        Enable customers to track points via receipt QR codes or an app.

        Offer bonus points for off-peak visits, trying new products, or leaving feedback.

    Experience-Based Rewards

        Host occasional “Loyalty Members-Only” tastings for new items.

        Reward top customers with personalized offers (e.g., “Your favorite smoothie is 50% off this week”).

Cross-Selling & Marketing Activation

    In-Store Nudges Train staff to suggest bundles (e.g., “Would you like to add a Granola Bar for €2 with your Smoothie”)

    POS System Prompts Automatically suggest upgrades or bundles when certain items are selected.

    Visual Merchandising Feature bundles like “Avocado Toast + Cold Brew” or “Cookie + Tea” on counter signage and takeaway bags.

    Email & Social Campaigns

        “Try something new” series Promote Matcha or Macchiato with influencer-style visuals.

        “Fan Favorites” Showcase top bundles each month and encourage check-ins with rewards.

This strategy focuses on accelerating the café’s underperforming products while deepening customer loyalty and increasing overall revenue. By bundling slower items like Matcha Latte and Energy Ball with top-sellers, we drive trial through value and familiarity. Targeted loyalty perks for mid-tier customers — like time-based offers, personalized bundles, and a tiered rewards system — are designed to shift them into high-value behavior. Enhanced menu design, in-store nudges, and POS prompts support cross-selling, while email and social campaigns bring these strategies to life beyond the café. Altogether, this is a human-centric, data-informed growth plan built to optimize both the customer experience and the bottom line.
